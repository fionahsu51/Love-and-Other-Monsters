Rolling hills and nothing else for miles on end on that winding dirt road connecting the town to the rest of the world.","\n","^Ten years ago, I looked out the carriage window through teary eyes, drifting in and out of sleep. Every time the bumpy road jolted me awake, I would see those same hills, crawling by lazily, so indistinguishable from each other, it was like we were going nowhere at all.","\n","^I don’t sleep this time.","\n","^Here we go, miss.
