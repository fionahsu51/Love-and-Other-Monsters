You have seven days to discover what happened to your father
Each day will start in the morning where the player can review events from previous dates in her journal and will receive letters from the girlsâ€™ familiars
The place will get two choices of where to go, one at noon and one in the evening
At night the player can write one of the girls a letter and your familiar will deliver it
The new Van Helsing will be appointed at the end of the seven day midnight during a full moon. 
During the night of the final day, instead of writing letter, the player must choose the evidence to present in the trial. 
A perfect run will be triggered if the player chooses the three correct pieces of evidence, each unlocked when they romance each of the girls.
