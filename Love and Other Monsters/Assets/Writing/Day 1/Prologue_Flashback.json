Should we split up?","\n",{"#":"format:none"},{"#":"portrait: freya_young"},{"#":"speaker: freya_neutral_young"},"^Splitting up sounds efficient.","\n","^Since Delia’s my sister, I should know her favorite hiding spots.

Still, she could never resist pausing to smell the roses, quite literally.","\n","^The vast gardens of our Morgan Manor should have been a delight for her compared to what she was used to, so it was more than likely she would have chosen to hide among the flowers this time.","\n",{"#":"format:italic"},{"#":"bg:morgan_manor_garden"},{"#":"portrait: none"},"^I ventured towards one of the garden paths and searched amongst the meticulously cultivated flowerbeds, each one a vivid display of nature’s artistry.","\n","^I couldn’t help but smile at the notion of Dolores immersed in the garden’s beauty, taking in each bloom with childlike wonder.","\n","^She’d blend in seamlessly, her hair reflecting the warm sunbeams, mirroring the same fiery hues as the poppies that surrounded her, making her seem like an enchanting blossom amidst the blossoms.","\n","^A gentle breeze stirred the leaves above, making the garden come alive with its symphony of rustling leaves and chirping birds. The sun casted shifting patterns of light and shadow, making it increasingly hard to spot any hidden figure.","\n","^After a few more rounds of searching in the area, I figured that Dolores was not here.","\n","^As I strolled further into the heart of the garden, my ears pricked at the sound of distant laughter. A sense of determination propelled me forward as I followed the sound, weaving between hedges and flowerbeds with calculated steps.","\n","^I approached a radiant bed of crimson roses, their petals shimmering like rubies in the sunlight. I heard the laughter again, but it didn't sound like Dolores.","\n","^Curious, nevertheless, I carefully pushed aside a curtain of vines and flowers to discover the source of the sound.","\n","^It wasn’t Dolores, but Father and Uncle Claudius engaged in an animated game of croquet on a beautifully manicured lawn. I didn’t realize I had come this far.","\n","^Not wanting to interrupt their game, I began to leave, until my name came up in their conversation. I heard Uncle Claudius’ voice carrying across the garden.","\n",{"#":"format:none"},{"#":"portrait: claudius_young"},{"#":"speaker: claudius_smile_young"},"^Victoria’s such a dear now, isn’t she?
