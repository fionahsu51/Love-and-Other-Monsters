Freya enters the room and I don’t believe my eyes. She towers above Edith and her shoulders are as broad as the door she entered. 

A sincere smile crosses her golden rose skin as her olive green eyes meet mine.

Victoria... Good day to you.

#portrait: victoria
Good day to you as well.

It's been 10 years since you left and now you've finally come home. If only it were under different circumstances. How did you come to know?

#speaker: freya_uncertain #portrait: victoria
 I received a letter from Edith about my father being ill. I left as soon as I could, but not soon enough.
 
#speaker: freya_eyes_closed #portrait: freya
I offer my most heartfelt commiseration. Your father was...I will miss his exceptional acumen. 

#format:italic #speaker: freya_upset #portrait: none
Freya looks down somberly. Almost as if she’s avoiding looking around the room, afraid she’ll recall a memory of my father.

#format: none #portrait: freya
He always treated me like I was his own.

#portrait: victoria
Thank you. I’m still processing everything. 

#format:italic #speaker: freya_reluctant #portrait: none
I take a deep breath and find the courage to take a good look at Freya. She has her eyes fixated on my father’s chair. Her hands fidget as she uses her thumb to sheathe her sword back and forth. 

Although she is much bigger, Freya still looks as nervous as the little girl who was scared of being punished for what she just broke.

* [How have you been?]

     It’s been a long time. How are you keeping? 
    #format:italic  #portrait: none
     I wish it wasn’t so hard to look at Freya while I speak. 
     
    #speaker: freya_eyes_closed
     Freya sighs, just before she speaks

    I’ve continued my training as a monster hunter with my father. He has been very keen on me continuing the family tradition. As I understood it, you finished your studies?

    #portrait: victoria
    Yes, I just finished my exams. I studied philosophy.

    #speaker: freya_smirk #portrait: freya
    I do recall your tendency to rest your chin on your fingers whenever you were thinking. Your father did the same thing.

    #portrait: victoria
    Really, I must have learned it from him.
    
    #format:italic #speaker: freya_laugh #portrait: none
    Freya bursts into laughter. Her contagious laugh persuades me to join her.

*[You look like you’ve gotten stronger.]
    #format:none #speaker: freya_uncertain #portrait: victoria
    You look like you’ve gotten stronger. That sword looks heavy.
    
    #format:italic #speaker: freya_blushing
    Freya looks away, clearly taken back from the compliment.
    
    #format:none #portrait: freya
    That was rather gauche Victoria, but I appreciate your amiability.
    
    #speaker: freya_eyes_close 
    No, I lost track of time. I can’t be late for training.
    
    #speaker: freya_awkward
     I need to go, but it was a pleasure seeing you again and don’t go away for so long next time, yeah?

I was starting to think you’d forgotten about us. 

#portrait: victoria
I could never forget about you Freya. Or anyone else here in Castelonia! I was actually trying to finish my studies much quicker so that I could return home sooner. 

#portrait: freya
Well, it took you long enough. Maybe you’re not the studious girl your father thought you were.  

#speaker: freya_smirk
That was a joke.

#portrait: victoria
Oh Freya. Such wicked sense of humor. In those 10 years I missed everyone so much. I would still write to Edith, Dolores, and Delia. 

She would let me know how you were, since you never returned any of my letters. How is she?
 
#speaker: freya_eyes_closed #portrait: freya
Oh… Delia is not here at this moment. 

#portrait: victoria
Yes, she is not here in the room with us, but is she back home?

#format:italic #speaker: freya_upset #portrait: none
Freya pauses and looks down..

Just before Freya can speak, another voice emerges.

#format:none #portrait: claudius
Freya, there you are. 

#format:italic #speaker: default #speaker-cl: claudius_neutral #speaker-cr: freya_surprised #portrait: none
Freya’s father, Claudius, hastily storms into the room. He looks exactly the way I remember him, except now he has gray in his beard. His eyes look heavy and weary as he hasn’t slept well lately.

#format:none #portrait: claudius
What are you… ah, Victoria. 


#format:italic  #speaker-cr: freya_uncertain #portrait: none
Claudius’ scowl softens and his tone changes as he sees me.

#format:none  #portrait: claudius
My deepest condolences on the passing of your father. The angels themselves open heaven’s gates for the most benevolent.

#portrait: victoria
Thank you, Lord Hawthorne. I’m sorry for keeping Freya. She saw me arriving into town and stopped by to say hello.

#portrait: claudius
Pardon my intrusion, Miss Morgan. I had not been made aware of your arrival.

#portrait: victoria
I left school as soon as I graduated, but I… I didn’t make it in time.

#portrait: claudius
Mathias will be remembered as a loving father and an amicable friend to all who met him.

#portrait: victoria
Thank you, Lord Hawthorne. 

#speaker-cr: freya_reluctant #portrait: claudius
I beg your pardon, Miss Morgan. Freya and I must take our leave. We have pressing matters to attend to. Try not to be late next time. 

#format:italic #portrait: none
Cladius turns and smiles at me.

#format:none #speaker-cl: claudius_smile #portrait: claudius
It was a pleasure seeing you again.

Claudius begins to walk away. Freya takes a step towards the door but turns back to me. Her eyes widened and implored me. The massive wall of her frame seemed to be on the verge of crumbling.

#format:none #speaker: freya_surprised #portrait: freya
Victoria… maybe you should go to town. Much has changed since you left, and it will help get your mind off things, yeah?

#portrait: victoria 
Much thanks Freya, I certainly will.

#format:italic #speaker: freya_neutral #portrait: none
Freya nods and catches up to Claudius. Both of them leave the Morgan Manor.

Maybe Freya is right. Being in the manor is only going to make me feel worse. Perhaps I really should go into town and see what’s changed.
