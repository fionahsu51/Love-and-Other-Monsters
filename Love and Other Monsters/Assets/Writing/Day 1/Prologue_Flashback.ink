Victoria, our esteemed guests have arrived! 

#format:italic #portrait: none
 Father's voice resonated through my bedroom chamber, its echoes reaching even the far corners of the room.

Impatience welled up inside me as I tugged at my nursemaid Edith's dress, urging her to move faster. 

Edith had designed this outfit specifically for me when I expressed a desire to explore the world beyond the manor's walls, to learn about our town and assist Father in its management when I grow older. 

His smile and nod of approval had been accompanied by a request to prepare an outfit suitable for outdoor adventures with my friends. The attire allowed me the freedom to move as I pleased, in stark contrast to the restrictive dresses I usually wear.

#format:none #portrait: edith #speaker: edith_neutral
Victoria, you mustn't rush. Someday, you'll become the lady of this house, and a lady never hurries to greet her guests. If you wished to avoid tardiness, you should have started getting ready earlier.
	
	#format:italic #portrait: none
Her tone carried the wisdom of years of service. I pouted in response before replying.

#format:none
But I had no idea it would take this long to get dressed. I thought that wearing trousers would speed things up compared to donning a dress.

#format:none #portrait: edith #speaker: edith_neutral
Indeed, it’s a bit different, but there’s still your hair and corset to attend to, ensuring that everything is just right.

#format:italic #portrait: none
	After a series of clothespins, braiding, and rustling fabric, Edith finally released me, allowing me to dash out of my chamber. 

I raced down the grand staircase to reach Father, who stood by the open doors with his hands extended in greeting. I followed his gaze to the sight of Uncle Claudius, Freya, and Delia disembarking from their carriage.

An eager greeting formed on my lips, but I recalled Edith's counsel from earlier. I cleared my throat and straightened my posture, offering a respectful bow instead. 
	#format:none #bg:morgan_manor_front  #portrait: victoria_young #speaker-c1: claudius_neutral #speaker-c: freya_neutral_young #speaker-cr: delia_neutral
	Uncle Claudius, Freya, Delia, you've arrived.

	#format:none #portrait: mathias #speaker-1: mathias_smile #speaker-c1: claudius_neutral #speaker-c: freya_neutral_young #speaker-cr: delia_neutral

Ah, Claudius, Freya, and Delia.

	#format:italic #portrait: none #speaker: mathias_smile
	Father echoed my words with a hint of laughter in his voice as he tousled my hair. 
	
#format:none #portrait: victoria_young
	Father! Edie worked so hard on my hair.

#format:italic #portrait: none
I protested and attempted to smooth down my ruffled locks.

#format:italic #portrait: none #speaker-c1: freya_neutral_young #speaker-cr: delia_neutral
Freya and Delia acknowledged our presence with a nod, while Uncle Claudius and Father exchanged their secret handshake—a ritual shrouded in the camaraderie of years past. 

As Father invited Uncle Claudius indoors, Freya, Delia, and I lingered by the entrance to the manor.

#format:none #portrait: victoria_young
Have you seen Dolores?

#format:none #portrait: delia #speaker: delia_neutral
Not yet, but you know Dolores. 

She’ll appear when we least expect her. She’s bound to show up, I’m sure.

#format:italic #portrait: none #speaker-c1: delia_neutral #speaker-cr: freya_neutral_young
Delia shook her head and spoke in her usual gentle tone as Freya shook her head as well, reaffirming Delia’s words.

I chuckled, acknowledging the unpredictable nature of our friend.

#format: none #portrait: victoria_young
You’re absolutely right. I just hope she doesn’t arrive too late and miss all the fun.

#format:italic #portrait: none
Father cleared his throat, garnering our attention.

#format: none #portrait: mathias #speaker: mathias_neutral
Girls, please ensure you stay within the manor grounds, alright?

Claudius and I will be playing croquet in the gardens.

#format:italic #portrait: none
Before I could reply, Edith made her entrance, gracefully acknowledging our guests.

	#format:none #portrait: edith #speaker: edith_neutral
	Master Claudius, it’s a pleasure to see you again.

	Everything is ready for your game of croquet, and I’ll bring out some snacks and refreshments shortly. Would earl grey tea suffice?

	#format:none #portrait: claudius_young #speaker: claudius_smile_young
	Yes, that sounds delightful, Edith.

	#format:none #portrait: claudius_young #speaker: claudius_neutral_young
	Well, then, Matthias?

	#format:italic #portrait: none #speaker-c1: claudius_neutral_young #speaker-cr: matthias_neutral
	Uncle Claudius gestured for Father to lead the way to the gardens.

	As we were about to follow suit, Dolores burst through the gates, her exuberant voice heralding her arrival.

	#format:none #portrait: dolores_young #speaker: dolores_excited_young
	I’m hereeee~

	#format:italic #portrait: none
	She halted abruptly upon seeing me, her eyes widening with delight.

	#format:none #portrait: dolores_young #speaker: dolores_excited_young
	Victoria! Oh, my, you look quite dashing in those trousers!

	And Freya, you’re as dashing as ever! 

	Nobody informed me that Delia and I would be the only ones wearing dresses today.

	#format:italic #portrait: none
	Dolores scrutinized us, her lips forming a playful pout. Sensing her penchant for theatricality, I began to apologize, but was interrupted as she brightened again, clapping her hands together.

	#format:none #portrait: dolores_young #speaker: dolores_excited_young
	Oh, I know! You two can be our gallant princes, coming to our rescue from the cursed tower.
	#format:none #portrait: victoria_young
	That sounds enjoyable, but we’re meant to be outdoors today, remember?

	Father prefers that I stay outside the manor when he’s not present.

#format:none #portrait: dolores_young #speaker: dolores_neutral_young
Very well.

We can pretend to have a pretend tower outdoors, and you two can compete to see who can rescue us first!

#format:italic #portrait: none #speaker-c1: freya_neutral_young #speaker-cr: delia_smile
I exchanged glances with Freya and Delia to gauge their reactions. In response, Freya simply shrugged.

#format:none #portrait: freya_young #speaker: freya_neutral_young
Sounds like fun. It will give me a chance to hone my scouting skills.

#format:italic #portrait: none
I nodded in agreement.

#format:none #portrait: victoria_young
Yes, that sounds entertaining. Our gardens are vast, so we can play far from where Father and Uncle Claudius are enjoying their game. We can easily fetch refreshments from Edith when needed.

#format:none #portrait: dolores_young #speaker: dolores_excited_young
Splendid!

Lead the way, Victoria.

#format:italic #portrait: none
I realized that Father and Uncle Claudius had departed during our conversation with Dolores. I ushered Dolores inside and closed the front doors behind her before guiding everyone to the rear gardens.

#format:none #bg:morgan_manor_garden  #portrait: dolores_young #speaker: dolores_excited_young
Whoaaa, this is the first time I’ve seen what’s in the back of your manor, Victoria. It’s so beautiful out here!

#format:none #portrait: victoria_young
Yes, we often play indoors. 
	
	Edie does a wonderful job of keeping everything nice and pretty out here.

	#format:none #portrait: freya_young #speaker: freya_eyes_closed_young
	Well, I suppose this is indeed splendid, but our garden at the Hawthorne Manor has more perks.

	#format:italic #portrait: none
	Despite what she said, there was a tinge of amusement in her voice that suggested otherwise.

	#format:none #portrait: delia_young #speaker: delia_thinking
	Maybe, but I do wish Father would let the manor be more lively.

	#format:none #portrait: victoria_young #speaker: none
	Hmm, I don’t want to trample the flowers, so perhaps we should play further away. 

	Dolores, you wanted to play Sardines, right?

	#format:none #portrait: dolores_young #speaker: dolores_pout_young
It’s not Sardines, you two are going to save us from our prison! 

Wherever that may be.	

	#format:none #portrait: victoria_young
	Wait, so how exactly do you want us to save you?

	#format:none #portrait: dolores_young #speaker: dolores_excited_young
	After we all find a spot to convene, you two will turn around and count while Delia and I get whisked away by a monster to somewhere on the manor grounds. 

Then, after a minute, you two will have to come find and save us.

#format:none #portrait: freya_young #speaker: freya_smirk_young
So…Sardines.

#format:none #portrait: dolores_young #speaker: dolores_pout_young
Will you two please use your imaginations? It is not Sardines!

#format:none #portrait: delia_young #speaker: delia_smile
	Alright, alright, it’s not Sardines. Let’s find a suitable spot to count, so the Great Princess Dolores and I can get whisked away by an evil monster.

	#format:none #portrait: dolores_young #speaker: dolores_excited_young
	Oooh, I like the sound of that.

	#format:italic #bg:morgan_manor_clearing  #portrait: none
	We finally walked enough to find a clearing, further from the gardens.

	#format:none #portrait: dolores_young #speaker dolores_neutral_young
	Okay, I think this is far enough.

	Victoria, Freya, stay here and count to sixty. No cheating!

	Delia, come with me~

	#format:italic #portrait: none #speaker-c1: dolores_excited_young #speaker-cr: delia_smile
	Dolores grabbed Delia’s hand and started to back away from us.

	I rolled my eyes, but her energy was contagious and I couldn’t help but crack a smile.

	#format:none #portrait: victoria_young
	Alright, alright, we’ll be here. Please don’t break anything and get me in trouble while you’re hiding-

	#format:none #portrait: dolores_young #speaker: dolores_pout_young
	Getting kidnapped,

	#format:none #portrait: victoria_young
	Okay, getting kidnapped.

	#format:none #portrait: dolores_young #speaker: dolores_excited_young
	I won’t! I promise

#format:italic #portrait: none #speaker: freya_eyes_closed_young
With that, Freya and I turned our backs and started counting to sixty aloud. I could hear the rustling of footsteps behind me as Delia and Dolores executed their elaborate ‘kidnapping’ scheme. 

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, we reached sixty. I turned to Freya.

#format:none #portrait: victoria_young #speaker: freya_neutral_young
How do you want to do this? Should we split up? 

#format:none #portrait: freya_young #speaker: freya_neutral_young
Splitting up sounds efficient.

Since Delia’s my sister, I should know her favorite hiding spots. You’re more familiar with Dolores’ antics, so you can search for her.

#format:none #portrait: victoria_young
Yes, I do believe that sounds like the fastest way to go about this.

Let’s reconvene here once we find them both.

#format:italic #portrait: none #speaker: none
With a nod, we embarked on our mission to rescue Dolores and Delia from their imaginary captors in the sprawling gardens of my family’s manor. 

Knowing Dolores, she had a penchant for concealed nooks and crannies, favoring shadowy spots. Still, she could never resist pausing to smell the roses, quite literally. 

The vast gardens of our Morgan Manor should have been a delight for her compared to what she was used to, so it was more than likely she would have chosen to hide among the flowers this time. 

#format:italic #bg:morgan_manor_garden #portrait: none
I ventured towards one of the garden paths and searched amongst the meticulously cultivated flowerbeds, each one a vivid display of nature’s artistry. 

I couldn’t help but smile at the notion of Dolores immersed in the garden’s beauty, taking in each bloom with childlike wonder. 

She’d blend in seamlessly, her hair reflecting the warm sunbeams, mirroring the same fiery hues as the poppies that surrounded her, making her seem like an enchanting blossom amidst the blossoms.

A gentle breeze stirred the leaves above, making the garden come alive with its symphony of rustling leaves and chirping birds. The sun casted shifting patterns of light and shadow, making it increasingly hard to spot any hidden figure.

After a few more rounds of searching in the area, I figured that Dolores was not here. 

	As I strolled further into the heart of the garden, my ears pricked at the sound of distant laughter. A sense of determination propelled me forward as I followed the sound, weaving between hedges and flowerbeds with calculated steps. 

I approached a radiant bed of crimson roses, their petals shimmering like rubies in the sunlight. I heard the laughter again, but it didn't sound like Dolores. 

Curious, nevertheless, I carefully pushed aside a curtain of vines and flowers to discover the source of the sound. 

It wasn’t Dolores, but Father and Uncle Claudius engaged in an animated game of croquet on a beautifully manicured lawn. I didn’t realize I had come this far. 

Not wanting to interrupt their game, I began to leave, until my name came up in their conversation. I heard Uncle Claudius’ voice carrying across the garden.

	#format:none #portrait: claudius_young #speaker: claudius_smile_young
	Victoria’s such a dear now, isn’t she? She’s still very young, but she’s already starting to look more and more like her mother.

	#format:none #portrait: mathias #speaker-c1: mathias_smile #speaker-cr: claudius_neutral_young
	She is, isn’t she? I’m always worried it’s a little lonely for her here at the Morgan Manor, but she’s a champ. I’m glad she has Freya and Delia.

	#format:none #portrait: claudius_young #speaker-c1: mathias_neutral #speaker-cr: claudius_neutral_young
	Yes, well, Victoria will not have to worry about a thing with my daughters by her side. I’ve been training them to be warriors, and warriors they shall be.
	
#format:none #portrait: mathias #speaker-c1: mathias_concerned #speaker-cr: claudius_neutral_young
You’re training them already? At this age, Claudius?

	#format:none #portrait: claudius_young #speaker-c1: mathias_concerned #speaker-cr: claudius_neutral_young
I was as well, back in the day when I had relentless training to become Van Helsing. I’m preparing them for a monster attack, should it happen. Their training is not even half as challenging as mine when I was their age.

	#format:none #portrait: mathias #speaker-c1: matthias_concerned #speaker-cr: claudius_neutral_young
	I think they should be allowed to have the childhood we never had. They’re still young, Cloudy. 

Times are different now, I’ve seen it myself. There’s no need to be paranoid and anticipate an attack every other day.

#format:none #portrait: claudius_young #speaker-c1: mathias_concerned #speaker-cr: claudius_neutral_young
Paranoid? We’ve lost so many people in the past years, and you think being prepared is paranoia? 

I cannot believe this is the mentality you have after taking the Van Helsing title from right under my nose.

#format:none #portrait: mathias #speaker: matthias_sad
Claudius…I had no choice, I thought you understood.

#format:none #portrait: claudius_young #speaker-c1: matthias_sad #speaker-cr: claudius_neutral_young
You wanted to make things right because of Virelai, yes?

#format:none #portrait: mathias #speaker-c1: mathias_sad #speaker-cr: claudius_neutral_young
Yes, it was my fault.

#format:none #portrait: claudius_young #speaker-c1: mathias_sad #speaker-cr: claudius_surprised_young
Matt, what happened to your wife was unfortunate, but it was a natural occurrence that had nothing to do with monsters. 

Her sickness would have consumed her regardless, and you were right to think that it’s better to be safe than sorry.

#format:none #portrait: mathias #speaker-c1: mathias_sad #speaker-cr: claudius_neutral_young
No, that woman was saving her…making her better. 

I had to become Van Helsing to atone…the least I could do was give her a sanctuary in the woods-

#format:none #portrait: claudius_young #speaker-c1: mathias_sad #speaker-cr: claudius_surprised_young
You gave sanctuary to a vamp-

#format:italic #portrait: none
Intrigued by their conversation, I leaned in further, my curiosity getting the better of me. 

However, in my eagerness to eavesdrop, I lost my balance and tripped over a hidden root. I let out an embarrassed yelp as I tumbled forward, landing awkwardly in front of them. 

Uncle Claudius halted mid-sentence, his eyes widening in surprise. He exchanged a bemused glance with Father before sighing. I quickly dusted myself off, my cheeks flushed with embarrassment. 

#format:none #portrait: victoria_young #speaker-c1: mathias_neutral #speaker-cr: claudius_surprised_young

Sorry…

I…I was searching for Dolores, and I didn’t mean to interrupt your game or conversation.

#format:italic #portrait: none #speaker: mathias_smile
Father approached me with a warm smile, but there was a flicker of concern in his eyes. It seemed he was trying to gauge how much I overheard.

#format:none #portrait: mathias #speaker: mathias_smile
No harm done, Victoria. 

You’re always welcome to join us, but we don’t want to keep you from your game with Dolores and the others.

#format:italic #portrait: none #speaker-c1: edith_neutral #speaker-cr: cloaked-man
As I was about to respond, Edith approached hastily with a stranger in tow. Despite the broad daylight, the man was shrouded in a cloak and had a strange symbol on the back of his hand. 

Father noticed my gaze and gently pushed me towards Uncle Claudius as soon as he saw the man. 

#format:none #portrait: cloaked_man #speaker: cloaked_man
A word, sir.

#format:italic #portrait: none #speaker-c1: mathias_concerned #speaker-cr: cloaked_man
Father nodded and approached the cloaked man, leaning in to listen as the man whispered something into his ear. I noticed Father’s expression darkened for a brief moment before he turned to address Uncle Claudius and me.

#format:none #portrait: mathias #speaker: mathias_neutral
Victoria, Claudius, I’m sorry, but an urgent matter has come up so I’m going to have to cut our conversation short.

#format:none #portrait: victoria_young
Is it for work again?

#format:italic #portrait: none #speaker: none
I recalled the times Father had to take work trips, leaving me in the care of Edith.

Father offered me a warm smile despite the urgency of the situation.

#format:none #portrait: mathias #speaker: mathias_smile
Yes, but I will be back, hopefully by tonight, if not tomorrow morning. 

Don’t stay out too long, you hear? Listen to Edith and Uncle Claudius.

#format:italic #portrait: none #speaker: none
I nodded, watching him depart, a sense of mystery and concern lingering in the air as the cloaked man and Father engaged in their secret discussion as they left the garden.
